It appears that the only commands allowed in the "d" element of the SVG file are "M" (absolute move-to) and "c" (relative cubic Bezier curve).  This is
an entirely empirical observation: I tried "q" and "l" elements, and both failed with bizarre results.  I am guessing that somewhere inside the Sisyphus
firmware there is code that converts SVG files to whatever the Sisyphus uses internally, and that code has severe limitations.

It really doesn't matter, as it is simple to generate a straight line with the "c" command (just make the control point and end point the same).  It's just a
strange limitation. :)

There is a bug in the Sisyphus firmware that is a bit annoying.  To wit: if you ever have a track that fails to upload (which can easily happen if there are
commands in the "d" element that the Sisyphus doesn't understand), then ALL tracks will subsequently fail to upload unless you reload the web page.  A simple
page refresh is all that's required.  This bug has been reported.
